# @wanglihua/create-ezreal-app

Create React apps with no build configuration.

Create React App works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br>
If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/wanglihua007/ezreal/issues).<br>

## Quick Overview

```sh
yarn create @wanglihua/ezreal-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn start or yarn build
```

If you've previously installed `@wanglihua/create-ezreal-app` globally via `yarn add global @wanglihua/create-ezreal-app`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `yarn global remove @wanglihua/create-ezreal-app` to ensure that yarn always uses the latest version.

Then open [http://localhost:50051/](http://localhost:50051/) to see your app.<br>
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `yarn build`.



## What’s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

- React, JSX, ES6 and TypeScript syntax support.
- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
- Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need `-webkit-` or other prefixes.
- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.
